# Checkpoint 5

In this checkpoint we used ```NLTK```, ```Sklearn```and ```Pandas``` modules from Python to do the Natural Language Processing. You can find the code in the ```src``` folder and also online in the link below.

## Prerequisites

The project runs in Google Colab, that is a Jupyter notebook environment that just requires a google account to access. You can find the code here:
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1vkXyWHuunDX1hoypHX6fXfIy8f_q9vNC?authuser=1#scrollTo=a8f9f6d4

Alternatively, you can also download the ipynb notebook from ```src``` folder and upload it on Google Colab.

To run the code, just go to: Runtime -> Run all. If you have any troubles executing the code, go to: Runtime -> Restart run time, and run it again.

## Natural language processing question

"We want to study the cause and effect of an allegation being declared unsustained vs sustained. For this, we want to find what are the most common contents among unsustained allegations, and how they differ from the content of a declared sustained as this will be the entire method for our analysis.‚Äù By finding what are the most common contents among the unsustained and finding how they differ from the content of a declared sustained, we can see if the degree of the allegation is the defining factor between a sustained and unsustained allegation in our NLP Model.	

Our motivations and conclusions regarding this analysis can be found in the ```findings.pdf``` in the root directory.
