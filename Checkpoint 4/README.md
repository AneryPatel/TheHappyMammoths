# Checkpoint 4

In this checkpoint we used ```PySpark``` module from Python to do the Graph Analytics.

## Prerequisites
If you would like to run the code cells, the following packages are required. Otherwise, to view the notebook, only Jupyter Notebook and/or Jupyter Lab is needed.

Jupyter Notebook or Lab (Required)
NumPy 1.19.4
MatPlotLib 3.3.2
Scikit-Learn 0.23.2

## Graph analytics questions

1. Network analysis: Is there a connection between investigators and certain officers or districts who are involved in incidents that have unsustained complaints using connected components to test if there is a correlation between the two.

2. Centrality analysis: Where are the most influential (negatively) people in the CPD network? where the most unsustained reports are concentrated? We want to track the cascading effect between different police officers. Does one officer with a high number of complaints rub off his culture and behavior on another officer who has a relatively low number of complaints against him?

Our motivations and conclusions regarding this analysis can be found in the findings.pdf in the root directory.
