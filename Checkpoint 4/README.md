# Checkpoint 4

In this checkpoint we used ```PySpark```, ```Pandas``` and ```GraphFrames``` modules from Python to do the Graph Analytics.

## Prerequisites

We did our project in Google Colab, that is a Jupyter notebook environment that just requires a google account to access.

## Graph analytics questions

1. Network analysis: Is there a connection between investigators and certain officers or districts who are involved in incidents that have unsustained complaints using connected components to test if there is a correlation between the two.

2. Centrality analysis: Where are the most influential (negatively) people in the CPD network? where the most unsustained reports are concentrated? We want to track the cascading effect between different police officers. Does one officer with a high number of complaints rub off his culture and behavior on another officer who has a relatively low number of complaints against him?

Our motivations and conclusions regarding this analysis can be found in the ```findings.pdf``` in the root directory.
