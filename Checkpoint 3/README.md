# Checkpoint 3

In this checkpoint, we used D3.js, a JavaScript visualization library, to do interactive visualizations to see the relationship of unsustained allegations to variables that we think might be relevant. Our results can be found in the ObservableHQ notebook by clicking in the links provided below.

Additionally, intermediate steps and data files can be found in the `src/` folder. This includes files such as JSON and SQL queries that were used to construct the final visualization.

## Interactive Visualization

### 1. Bubble Chart

We did a Bubble Chart to view the evolution of unsustained allegations by area overt time. The query for the table used for this chart can be found in ```src/sql``` folder as ```data_area_query.sql``` and also the JSON in ```src/json```that was uploaded in ObservableHQ as ```data_area.json```. You can find the visualization in the following link:

### 2. Pie Chart

We did a Pie Chart with multiple filters to see how much the value of certain variables weighs in the declaration of unsustained allegation. The query for the tables used for this chart can be found in ```src/sql``` and ```src/json```. You can find the visualization in the following link:

Our analysis and conclusions regarding this charts can be found in the ```findings.pdf``` in the root directory.
