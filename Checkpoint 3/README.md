# Checkpoint 3

In this checkpoint, we used D3.js, a JavaScript visualization library, to do interactive visualizations to see the relationship of unsustained allegations to variables that we think might be relevant. Our results can be found in the ObservableHQ notebook or by opening the browser shorcut in the `src/` folder.

Additionally, intermediate steps and data files can be found in the `src/misc/` folder. This includes files such as JSON and SQL queries that were used to construct the final visualization.
